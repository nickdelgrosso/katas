- state could be stored as the string representation - it's actually more readable once you get used to it
- we could avoid mutable state: `reduce` iso `for` loop
- we could do something like storing the intermediate states - no overriding of previous state
- it's much like cubetto - we can extend it like cubetto (functions, random, not / reverse)
- did not support multiple rovers
- did not test bad input
- did not test for 'rover out of plateau'
- visualize the movement - with a cli?
- multiple rovers - collisions?
- manual override
- separate the movement from the instructions - a rover could be a separate thread / process taking instructions through an api; the plateau is a shared state of all rovers
- this could turn into a capture the flag type of adverserial game between bots
- this seems like a good candidate for the max lexical complexity kata
