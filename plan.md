# kata ideas

- TDD kata, but every refactoring must get to lexical complexity of X (e.g. 1)
- ACN
- following this TDD chart: https://quinngil.com/tdd-like-you-mean-it/
- code smells
- impl a memory card game
- CD kata: develop bots that play an adverserial game (like the lean poker)
- build a XUnit framework
- code generation
- templating
- full stack TDD (double loop?)
- chat app
- websockets, long poll, server sent events
- long running kata, over years, to enmulate the problems that come with real-life projects
- property-based testing
- approval tests
- refactor to patterns
- undo
- guilded rose
- naming as a process

# workflow

- prefer mobbing, or pairing
- leave time for a retro / note taking / thinking
